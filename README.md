# Can indicators of heart disease indicatate diabetes?
## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artifical Intelligence) which focuses on using indicators of heart disease and seeing if they are able to detect diabetes as well.

## Problem Definition
* Are we able to use indictators of Heart Disease to detect Diabetes?

## Models Used
* Classification Tree
* Random Forest

## Conclusion
* Indicators of Heart Disease can be used to detect Diabetes.
* However, it should not be solely relied on to detect Diabetes.
* A Diabetes Detection test can use these variables to help detect but it should be used hand in hand with other variables
* BMI had the highest accuracy in detecting Diabetes, followed by Age Catergory and Difficulty Walking
1. BMI
2. agecatergory
3. DiffWalking_Quantified
4. HeartDisease_Quantified
5. KidneyDisease_Quantified 
6. Smoking_Quantified
7. Alcohol

## What did we learn from this project?
* Undersampling to balance out our data to ensure no data biasness
* Oversampling to balance out our data, however we used undersampling as we did not want to duplicate data
* Other packages such as dython
* Random Forest from sklearn
* Concepts abouts Rebalancing, Over Sampling, Under Sampling, Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
